# Data-Cleaning

**Luis Fernando LÃ³pez Corrales**

## Data
The data is from Kaggle, an open data science hub where you can find free data to work with, among other things.

## Scope
This was one of the first projects in the IronHack bootcamp, where the main goal was merely dive into the cleaning of data. So, the data set was quite messy...
